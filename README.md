# War
A simple simulation of the **WAR** card game which is a part of the assignment for the Python course taught by Jose Portilla. It consists of two computer players competing against each other once the game is started. I have made use of the OOP paradigm to code. It has been written in Python 3.

It consists of the following classes:

Card
Deck
Player
